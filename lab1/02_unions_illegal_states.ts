// 02 UNIONS: make illegal states unrepresentable
// Lecture 2, slides 15-16.
// Story: a model-training job is queued, running, done or failed.
//
// GOAL : 0 red underlines AND every line in the Logs tab says PASS.
// RULES: do NOT use  any ,  as  or the  !  operator.

// ---- BEFORE: one "bag of optional fields" ---------------------------------------
interface JobLoose {
	status: "queued" | "running" | "done" | "failed";
	progress?: number; // only meaningful while running
	accuracy?: number; // only meaningful when done
	error?: string; // only meaningful when failed
}
// This compiles. It is nonsense: a queued job that has an accuracy AND an error.
const nonsense: JobLoose = {
	status: "queued",
	accuracy: 0.99,
	error: "out of memory",
};

// ---- TASK 1 - redesign it as a discriminated union ------------------------------
// One object type per state. Each has a literal  kind  tag and ONLY its own fields:
//   queued  -> no extra fields            running -> progress: number   (0..1)
//   done    -> accuracy: number           failed  -> error: string
type Job =
	| { kind: "queued" }
	| { kind: "running"; progress: number }
	| { kind: "done"; accuracy: number }
	| { kind: "failed"; error: string }

// Compile-time tests. Do not edit them.
// "@ts-expect-error" means: the NEXT line MUST be a type error.
// If your type is too loose, the directive itself gets a red underline.
const ok1: Job = { kind: "done", accuracy: 0.93 };
const ok2: Job = { kind: "failed", error: "out of memory" };
// @ts-expect-error  a queued job cannot carry an accuracy
const bad1: Job = { kind: "queued", accuracy: 0.99 };
// @ts-expect-error  a done job must have an accuracy
const bad2: Job = { kind: "done" };
// @ts-expect-error  a running job has no error message
const bad3: Job = { kind: "running", progress: 0.5, error: "?" };

// ---- TASK 2 - one function, every state handled ---------------------------------
// Return exactly:
//   "waiting" | "running 40%" | "done, accuracy 0.93" | "FAILED: out of memory"
// Inside each  case  hover over  job : the type is narrowed to that one state.
function describe(job: Job): string {
	switch (job.kind) {
		case "queued":
			return "waiting";
		case "running":
			return "running " + Math.round(job.progress * 100) + "%";
		case "done":
			return "done, accuracy " + job.accuracy;
		case "failed":
			return "FAILED: " + job.error;
	}
}

// ---- TASK 3 - change the design, let the compiler find the work ------------------
// Add a fifth state to Job:   { kind: "cancelled"; by: string }
// Do NOT touch  describe  yet. Where does the red underline appear, and why?, add it as a comment.
// Then handle it:  "cancelled by Leyla" , and un-comment the last check below.
// Question: with JobLoose, how would you have found every place to update?
//
// Answer: after adding "cancelled" to Job, the red underline appears on the return
// type  string  of  describe  ("Function lacks ending return statement and return
// type does not include 'undefined'"). The switch no longer covers every kind, so
// for a cancelled job execution falls off the end and returns undefined.
// With JobLoose the compiler would not complain anywhere: status is just a string
// union and the fields are optional, so we would have to search the code by hand
// (grep for "status") and hope we found every place.

// ---- self-check (do not edit) ---------------------------------------------------
